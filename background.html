        <p id="backgroundinfo">My name is Saul Pacheco Fuentes, my story starts in the Bronx where I went to school at BCSC and later went on to MS343 and in the status quo I go to HSMSE. 
            In my earlier years of life I attended an after school program offered by Mercy Center, a local place which strives to help anyone in need and put young children up into positions of power.  
            As my life progressed I went through many chapters, such as when I was part of a program called Oliver Scholars where they launched a pilot program which offered the program for students who were not yet in Middle School. 
            As a result this program pushed me to my limits and made me excel beyond anything I couldâ€™ve imagined. 
            I later on moved to multiple other programs which were mostly offered by Fiver Children's Foundation Inc. 
            The periods where I interned not only taught me crucial aspects of being a worker in a professional environment but it also taught me how to balance my personal life with my job life. 
            It taught me that although working could be difficult it did not always have to be so monotone.
