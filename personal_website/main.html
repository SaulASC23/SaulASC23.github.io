            <p id="vitatement">My vision for this world is one where anyone regardless of gender or race can thrive in this world.
                I hope for a world where the only roadblocks in the world are those imposed by ourselves. A world where people like 
                me can do realize they ideas into reality regardless of their status quo. I know that I can make my dream reality by outreaching 
                to communities full of people who just need one chance to prove everything that they are and capable of. For example roughly one 
                three Bronx residents live below the poverty line. Who know's what that percentage of people are capable of what their dreams 
                are. All they need is one chance just like i've recieved along with millions of others, I hope to bring my experience to the smaller 
                majority who aren't as fortunate as me to have access to the resources I have.
