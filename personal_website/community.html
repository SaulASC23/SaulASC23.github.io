            <p>Mercy Center plays a large part into my life, it not only helped me when I was struggling as a student who did'nt know english,
                but it also helped me transition throughout my life. One of the most important people in my life the main supervisor there was 
                a wonderful person called Ms. Marriane, she not only helped me and my family in times of struggle but a whole community
