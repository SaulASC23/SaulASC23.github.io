                    My education starts as The Bronx Charter School for Children, this place is full of many memories whether it be bad or good. 
                    It was full of amazing staff and teachers along with great and many friends. 
                    Although the most important experience I had was the exposure to advanced mathematics, I was introduced to a course where I was taught advanced math so that I could have a better edge when applying to schools and programs. 
                    As a result of this I was fortunate enough to get into a program called Oliver Scholars which forever changed my future for the better.

                <p>
                    One of the most important chapters of my life, Middle School, molded the very person typing this out right now. 
                    I made lifelong friends here similar to my elementary school experience. Except here it was different, I had responsibilities I would’ve never imagined, I had to walk to school and back by myself. 
                    Although scary it was exciting, it was finally some liberty from my overbearing parents. 
                    I was taking classes that were challenging me and forcing me to exercise my brain and collaborating powers to the fullest extent. It made me rethink whether or not I was capable of this or not. 
                    But along every step of the way my friends and parents encouraged me and that was the main driver as to why I am where I stand right now.

                <p>
                    High School is the most important chapter of my life as of right now and will most likely always be. 
                    It not only molds my character and preferences but as well as my future, it not only decides what I might do for the rest of my future career but it also plays into who I know. 
                    I currently go to the High School for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. 
                    Going into this school was a big leap; it not only pushed me to my limits but also forced me to come out of my shell. 
                    I was forced to talk with people I would’ve never thought I’d meet, it pushed me to my limits in terms of my education. 
                    I was taking classes more advanced than anything I had seen, I took my first AP tests which were nerve racking, I even took the PSAT for the first time. 
                    Although these might seem like small steps at the time it was the greatest leaps ever. At some point I was struggling so hard I started to develop imposter syndrome and wonder if I really deserved to hold a spot in the specialized school I currently attend. I started thinking about how many other people could be in the seat I was in and doing so much better. 
                    I discussed this with my parents and guidance counselor and they helped me realize that I was in this school for a reason, I held that seat for the fact that I tried my hardest to get in.
